# Task 7: Port index.vue

Part of the Nuxt 2 to Vue 3 SPA migration.
Master plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-13-nuxt2-to-vue3-migration.md`
Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-nuxt2-to-vue3-migration-design.md`

You are being given only this task. Do not do work belonging to other tasks.
Read the constraints below before starting; they are not optional.

## Global Constraints

- Package manager is pnpm. Never run `npm install` or `yarn` after Task 1.
- `node` is not on PATH in this environment. pnpm ships its own runtime; use `pnpm env use --global lts` if a bare `node` binary is needed.
- Behaviour is preserved. This is a framework migration, not a redesign. Any visual or functional difference from the current app is a bug unless this plan explicitly calls for it.
- The browser calls the Avior encoding daemons directly at their absolute LAN addresses. Do not introduce a proxy for them. Only MongoDB stays behind Express.
- App-origin API calls use relative paths (`/api/...`) in both dev and prod. No `baseURL` is configured anywhere. This is deliberate: a configured base URL is what broke before.
- Vuetify 4 (currently 4.1.4), not Vuetify 3. Vuetify 4 is still a Vue 3 library — the major bump is not about Vue 4. It requires `vue: ^3.5.0`, which we have.
- Vuetify 4 uses Material Design 3. Typography, elevation (25 levels down to 6), default breakpoints, `VContainer` max-widths, and button casing (no more uppercase default) all differ from Vuetify 2 by design. These visual differences are EXPECTED and are not migration bugs. Do not "fix" them back. What must match the old app is structure and behaviour: the same elements, the same hierarchy, the same interactions, the same data. Exact pixels, font sizes, and shadows will not match, and that is correct.
- Theme: Vuetify 4 stock dark theme, with exactly two color overrides — `primary: #9E9E9E`, `secondary: #FF8F00`. Do not port the old accent/info/warning/error/success entries. Set `defaultTheme: 'dark'` explicitly: Vuetify 4 changed the default to follow system preference, which would otherwise give a light app.
- Our own components are imported explicitly. Vuetify's components are auto-imported by `vite-plugin-vuetify`. Do not add `unplugin-vue-components` for our components.
- There is no test suite, by the user's explicit choice. Every task's verification step is a manual observation against the running app. Never claim a task works without having actually run the stated command and seen the stated result.
- Every task ends with the app in a runnable state and a commit.
- Ports during coexistence: Nuxt dev on 3000, Vite dev on 5173, Express standalone on 10009. These must not collide.
- `Jenkinsfile` is legacy and out of scope. Do not modify it. CI that matters is `.github/workflows/main.yml`, which only calls `docker build`.
- Server stack is Mongoose 9, Express 5, Node 24 (Task 2b). The upstream MongoDB was upgraded, and Mongoose 9 requires Node >= 20.19. Express 5 rejects a bare `'*'` path — the SPA fallback is `'/*splat'`. Do not reintroduce `body-parser`; Express has the parsers built in.
- MongoDB at 10.11.194.75 is NOT reachable from the development machine. A hanging or 500-ing `/api/clients` locally is the environment, not a bug. Never claim a successful query.

## Ported-file conventions

Tasks 4 through 12 all port Vue 2 + Vuetify 2 SFCs to Vue 3 + Vuetify 4. Every one of them follows the same rules. Read this section before starting any of those tasks; the per-task notes list only which of these apply and any file-specific gotchas.

### Template: Vuetify 2 to Vuetify 3

| Vuetify 2 | Vuetify 3 |
|---|---|
| `<v-list-item-content>…</v-list-item-content>` | removed — unwrap the children into the `v-list-item` directly |
| `<v-list-item-title>` | kept, but now a direct child of `v-list-item` |
| `<v-list-item-subtitle>` | kept, but now a direct child of `v-list-item` |
| `<v-list-item-action>` | removed — use `<template #append>` or `#prepend` on `v-list-item` |
| `<v-list-item-icon>` | removed — use `<template #prepend>` with `<v-icon>` |
| `<v-list-item-group v-model="x">` | removed — put `v-model:selected` on `<v-list>` and give each `v-list-item` a `:value` |
| `<v-tabs-items v-model="tab">` | `<v-window v-model="tab">` |
| `<v-tab-item>` | `<v-window-item>` |
| `<v-tabs-slider>` | removed — no replacement tag; slider is styled via props on `v-tabs` |
| `<v-subheader>` | `<v-list-subheader>` |
| `<v-layout>` / `<v-flex>` | `<v-row>` / `<v-col>` |
| `app`, `fixed`, `clipped`, `clipped-left` props on `v-app-bar` / `v-navigation-drawer` / `v-footer` / `v-main` | all removed — Vuetify 4 computes layout geometry itself |
| `dark` prop on any component | removed — the theme handles it; simply delete the attribute |
| `:mini-variant="x"` on `v-navigation-drawer` | `:rail="x"` |
| `v-data-table` `headers: [{ text, value }]` | `headers: [{ title, key }]` |
| `v-data-table` slot `#item.foo` | `#item.foo` still, but `foo` now matches the header `key` |
| `v-data-table` `:items-per-page` etc. | unchanged, but check the component renders before assuming |
| `<v-time-picker>` | still in Vuetify labs — needs an explicit labs import (see Task 3) |

### Template: additional Vuetify 4 changes

The table above covers what Vuetify 3 removed. Vuetify 4 changes more on top of it. These apply too:

| Vuetify 3 | Vuetify 4 |
|---|---|
| `<v-row dense>` | `<v-row density="compact">` (or `gap="8"`) |
| `<v-row align="center">` / `justify="..."` / `align-content="..."` | props removed — use the equivalent utility class on the row (`align-center`, `justify-center`, …), including the responsive variants (`align-sm`, `order-md`, …) |
| `<v-col order="2">` / `align-self="..."` | props removed — use utility classes |
| `v-select` / `v-combobox` / `v-autocomplete` slot `#item` | renamed `#internalItem`. `item` survives as an alias for `internalItem.raw`, so read the slot body before changing it |
| `v-container fill-height` centering | no longer centers vertically — add `d-flex align-center flex-wrap` if the centering was load-bearing |
| `elevation-8` and similar, up to 24 | elevation is now 0-5 only. Map anything above 5 down; a codemod exists |
| `text-h1` … `text-caption` typography classes | renamed to the MD3 scale (`text-display-large`, `text-headline-small`, `text-body-medium`, …). A codemod exists |
| `v-btn` uppercase by default | no longer uppercase. If a specific button's casing matters, set it explicitly |

The grid is the one to be careful with: Vuetify 4 rebuilt `v-row`/`v-col` on CSS `gap` instead of negative margins. Read what a row is actually doing before converting it.

The current codebase is Vuetify 2, so it does not use the MD3 typography or elevation class names anywhere — those rows matter only if a port introduces them. Do not introduce them.

### Template: Vue 3 core

- Component `v-model` contract changes from `value` + `input` to `modelValue` + `update:modelValue`. This affects `TextDataTable.vue` only (Task 12).
- `v-model` on Vuetify's own components (`v-text-field`, `v-dialog`, `v-tabs`, etc.) is unchanged from the template author's point of view. Leave those alone.

### Script (Tasks 4-12 only — keep Options API and JavaScript)

Do not convert scripts to `<script setup>` or TypeScript in these tasks. That is Task 14, deliberately kept separate so that a broken page has exactly one possible cause. Change only what Vue 3 genuinely breaks:

- `this.$set(obj, key, val)` becomes `obj[key] = val`. `this.$delete(obj, key)` becomes `delete obj[key]`. Vue 3's reactivity is proxy-based and tracks these natively. (Task 10 only.)
- `this.$http.$get(url)` becomes `get(url)` imported from `@/api/http`; likewise `$post`/`$put`/`$delete` become `post`/`put`/`del`. Signatures are identical, so this is a mechanical substitution.
- Nuxt's `async fetch() {…}` hook has no Vue 3 equivalent. Rename the method to `refresh()`, move it into `methods`, and call it from `mounted()`. Any `this.$fetch()` call becomes `this.refresh()`.
- Nuxt's `$fetchState.pending` (if present in a template) becomes a plain `loading` data property that `refresh()` sets true on entry and false on exit.
- `process.env.commitSha` becomes `import.meta.env.VITE_COMMIT_SHA`.
- Add explicit `import` statements for every one of our own components used in the template.

### Verification for every port task

There is no test suite. Verification means:

1. `pnpm dev` (Vite, port 5173) and `pnpm dev:api` (Express, port 10009) both running.
2. Open the ported page in the browser.
3. Open the old Nuxt app (`pnpm dev:nuxt`, port 3000) at the same page, side by side.
4. Compare them, applying the right standard. What must match: every element is present, the hierarchy and grouping are the same, every interaction works, and the same data appears. What will NOT match, by design, because Vuetify 4 is Material Design 3: font sizes and weights, shadow depths, button label casing, exact spacing and breakpoints. Do not chase those. If you cannot tell whether a difference is intentional MD3 or a real regression, say so in your report rather than guessing — a wrong guess in either direction is worse than an open question.
5. Check the browser console. Zero errors and zero Vue warnings. Vuetify warns loudly about removed props, so a clean console is a real signal here — this, rather than pixel comparison, is now the sharpest tool for catching a bad port.

## Task 7: Port index.vue

Stage 6b. The Overview page. Depends on Task 6.

Files:
- Modify: `src/pages/index.vue` (replace the scaffold placeholder with the port of `pages/index.vue`, 254 lines)
- Reference (do not modify): the original

Interfaces:
- Consumes: `src/components/Client.vue` (Task 6), `get` from `@/api/http`.

- [ ] Step 1: Port the template

`v-skeleton-loader` is the only changed Vuetify API here. Add `import Client from '@/components/Client.vue'` and register it.

- [ ] Step 2: Port the script

- The `async fetch()` hook at line 35 becomes `refresh()` in `methods`, called from `mounted()`. If the template uses `$fetchState.pending`, replace it with a `loading` data property set by `refresh()`.
- `this.$http.$get` calls at lines 145, 148, 158, and 177 become `get(...)`.
- Line 158 (`get("api/clients")`) is an app-origin call. Note that the original passes `"api/clients"` without a leading slash, which resolves relative to the current path — it happens to work at `/` but would break on a nested route. Change it to `"/api/clients"`. This is a latent bug fix; call it out in the commit message.
- Lines 145, 148, and 177 are absolute daemon URLs and stay absolute.

The address-resolution logic (the `/alive` race, around line 177) stays duplicated for now. It is extracted into a composable in Task 14, deliberately, so that this task changes only what Vue 3 breaks.

- [ ] Step 3: Confirm `Promise.any` still resolves

The original relies on the `promise.any` polyfill, transpiled by Nuxt. Vite does not transpile it and does not need to — `Promise.any` is natively available. If the file imports `promise.any` explicitly, remove the import and use the native global. Do not remove the dependency from `package.json` yet; that happens in Task 14 once every consumer is ported.

- [ ] Step 4: Verify

Open `http://localhost:5173/` and `http://localhost:3000/` side by side.

Expected: the same client cards, in the same order, with the same live/offline status. The address race resolves and each online client shows its encoder line-out. Skeleton loaders appear while loading. Console clean.

- [ ] Step 5: Commit

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: port Overview page to Vue 3 + Vuetify 4

Nuxt's fetch() hook becomes refresh() from mounted(). Fixes a latent bug: the
client registry was fetched from the relative path 'api/clients' rather than
'/api/clients', which only worked because this page is mounted at the root.

Address-resolution logic remains duplicated here; it is extracted into a
composable in the TypeScript pass."
```
