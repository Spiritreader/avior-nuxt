# Task 11: Port jobs.vue and JobDataTable.vue

Part of the Nuxt 2 to Vue 3 SPA migration.
Master plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-13-nuxt2-to-vue3-migration.md`
Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-nuxt2-to-vue3-migration-design.md`

You are being given only this task. Do not do work belonging to other tasks.
Read the constraints below before starting; they are not optional.

## Global Constraints

- Package manager is pnpm. Never run `npm install` or `yarn` after Task 1.
- `node` is not on PATH in this environment. pnpm ships its own runtime; use `pnpm env use --global lts` if a bare `node` binary is needed.
- Behaviour is preserved. This is a framework migration, not a redesign. Any visual or functional difference from the current app is a bug unless this plan explicitly calls for it.
- The browser calls the Avior encoding daemons directly at their absolute LAN addresses. Do not introduce a proxy for them. Only MongoDB stays behind Express.
- App-origin API calls use relative paths (`/api/...`) in both dev and prod. No `baseURL` is configured anywhere. This is deliberate: a configured base URL is what broke before.
- Theme: Vuetify 3 stock dark theme, with exactly two color overrides — `primary: #9E9E9E`, `secondary: #FF8F00`. Do not port the old accent/info/warning/error/success entries.
- Our own components are imported explicitly. Vuetify's components are auto-imported by `vite-plugin-vuetify`. Do not add `unplugin-vue-components` for our components.
- There is no test suite, by the user's explicit choice. Every task's verification step is a manual observation against the running app. Never claim a task works without having actually run the stated command and seen the stated result.
- Every task ends with the app in a runnable state and a commit.
- Ports during coexistence: Nuxt dev on 3000, Vite dev on 5173, Express standalone on 10009. These must not collide.

## Ported-file conventions

Tasks 4 through 12 all port Vue 2 + Vuetify 2 SFCs to Vue 3 + Vuetify 3. Every one of them follows the same rules. Read this section before starting any of those tasks; the per-task notes list only which of these apply and any file-specific gotchas.

### Template: Vuetify 2 to Vuetify 3

| Vuetify 2 | Vuetify 3 |
|---|---|
| `<v-list-item-content>…</v-list-item-content>` | removed — unwrap the children into the `v-list-item` directly |
| `<v-list-item-title>` | kept, but now a direct child of `v-list-item` |
| `<v-list-item-subtitle>` | kept, but now a direct child of `v-list-item` |
| `<v-list-item-action>` | removed — use `<template #append>` or `#prepend` on `v-list-item` |
| `<v-list-item-icon>` | removed — use `<template #prepend>` with `<v-icon>` |
| `<v-list-item-group v-model="x">` | removed — put `v-model:selected` on `<v-list>` and give each `v-list-item` a `:value` |
| `<v-tabs-items v-model="tab">` | `<v-window v-model="tab">` |
| `<v-tab-item>` | `<v-window-item>` |
| `<v-tabs-slider>` | removed — no replacement tag; slider is styled via props on `v-tabs` |
| `<v-subheader>` | `<v-list-subheader>` |
| `<v-layout>` / `<v-flex>` | `<v-row>` / `<v-col>` |
| `app`, `fixed`, `clipped`, `clipped-left` props on `v-app-bar` / `v-navigation-drawer` / `v-footer` / `v-main` | all removed — Vuetify 3 computes layout geometry itself |
| `dark` prop on any component | removed — the theme handles it; simply delete the attribute |
| `:mini-variant="x"` on `v-navigation-drawer` | `:rail="x"` |
| `v-data-table` `headers: [{ text, value }]` | `headers: [{ title, key }]` |
| `v-data-table` slot `#item.foo` | `#item.foo` still, but `foo` now matches the header `key` |
| `v-data-table` `:items-per-page` etc. | unchanged, but check the component renders before assuming |
| `<v-time-picker>` | still in Vuetify labs — needs an explicit labs import (see Task 3) |

### Template: Vue 3 core

- Component `v-model` contract changes from `value` + `input` to `modelValue` + `update:modelValue`. This affects `TextDataTable.vue` only (Task 12).
- `v-model` on Vuetify's own components (`v-text-field`, `v-dialog`, `v-tabs`, etc.) is unchanged from the template author's point of view. Leave those alone.

### Script (Tasks 4-12 only — keep Options API and JavaScript)

Do not convert scripts to `<script setup>` or TypeScript in these tasks. That is Task 14, deliberately kept separate so that a broken page has exactly one possible cause. Change only what Vue 3 genuinely breaks:

- `this.$set(obj, key, val)` becomes `obj[key] = val`. `this.$delete(obj, key)` becomes `delete obj[key]`. Vue 3's reactivity is proxy-based and tracks these natively. (Task 10 only.)
- `this.$http.$get(url)` becomes `get(url)` imported from `@/api/http`; likewise `$post`/`$put`/`$delete` become `post`/`put`/`del`. Signatures are identical, so this is a mechanical substitution.
- Nuxt's `async fetch() {…}` hook has no Vue 3 equivalent. Rename the method to `refresh()`, move it into `methods`, and call it from `mounted()`. Any `this.$fetch()` call becomes `this.refresh()`.
- Nuxt's `$fetchState.pending` (if present in a template) becomes a plain `loading` data property that `refresh()` sets true on entry and false on exit.
- `process.env.commitSha` becomes `import.meta.env.VITE_COMMIT_SHA`.
- Add explicit `import` statements for every one of our own components used in the template.

### Verification for every port task

There is no test suite. Verification means:

1. `pnpm dev` (Vite, port 5173) and `pnpm dev:api` (Express, port 10009) both running.
2. Open the ported page in the browser.
3. Open the old Nuxt app (`pnpm dev:nuxt`, port 3000) at the same page, side by side.
4. Confirm the layout matches and the page's interactions work.
5. Check the browser console. Zero errors and zero Vue warnings. Vuetify emits loud warnings for removed props, so a clean console is a real signal here.

## Task 11: Port jobs.vue and JobDataTable.vue

Stage 8. First `v-data-table` conversion. Independent of Tasks 8-10 and can run in parallel with them once Task 4 has landed.

Files:
- Create: `src/pages/jobs.vue` (625 lines)
- Create: `src/components/JobDataTable.vue` (204 lines)

Interfaces:
- Consumes: `get`/`post`/`put`/`del` from `@/api/http`.

`JobDataTable.vue` defines its headers at lines 119-121 in the Vuetify 2 shape (`{ text: "Name", value: "Name" }`, `{ text: "Actions", value: "actions", sortable: false, align: "right" }`). Every one becomes `{ title: …, key: … }`. Item slots keyed on the old `value` must be re-keyed on the new `key`; since the values are unchanged (`Name`, `actions`), the slot names happen to stay the same — but confirm that rather than assuming it.

`jobs.vue` also uses `v-system-bar`, `v-list-item-content`, `v-list-item-icon`, and `v-list-item-group`.

- [ ] Step 1: Port `JobDataTable.vue`, converting the header schema and checking every item slot renders.

- [ ] Step 2: Port `jobs.vue`. The `async fetch()` at line 332 becomes `refresh()` from `mounted()`. The `$http` calls at lines 394, 422, 443, 461, 466, 477, 498, 574, 592, and 613 become the wrapper's helpers. Line 584 (`"api/clients"`) is app-origin and gains a leading slash. The rest are absolute daemon URLs.

- [ ] Step 3: Verify

Open `http://localhost:5173/jobs` and `http://localhost:3000/jobs` side by side.

Expected: the job table renders with the same columns, same sort behaviour, and same row actions. Sorting by a column works. The job de-duplication logic behaves identically — this is one of the two places the spec flags as able to regress silently, so exercise it deliberately: add a job that already exists and confirm the app handles it the same way the old one does. Deleting a job works. Console clean.

- [ ] Step 4: Commit

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: port jobs page and JobDataTable to Vue 3 + Vuetify 3

First v-data-table conversion: header schema moves from {text,value} to
{title,key}. Job de-duplication behaviour verified against the old app."
```
